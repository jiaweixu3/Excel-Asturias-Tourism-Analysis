# üìä Excel Project: Asturias Tourism Dashboard

## ‚ú® Summary

This project is a comprehensive **Microsoft Excel dashboard and analysis** of tourism trends in the Principality of Asturias, using public data from **[SADEI](https://www.sadei.es/sadei/informacion-estadistica/banco-de-datos_263_1_ap.html)**.  

We analyzed **over 50,000 data points** from multiple datasets, including:

- Hotels and restaurants by council  
- Spending of national tourists  
- Travel motivations  
- Index prices of hotels  
- Traveler types and valuations  

The analysis includes comparisons with the rest of Spain to provide a competitive benchmark. The final dashboard is dynamic, multi-sheet, and highlights advanced Excel capabilities such as Pivot Tables, dynamic charts, and interactive macros.

Here is a screenshot of the dashboard (the Excel file itself is fully interactive):
